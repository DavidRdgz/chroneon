# Chroneon

A web app dashboard to record and train models to predict gestures from EMG signals.

# Purpose

This shiny web application is intended to provide a user friendly experience for researchers
using EMG (or any other time series signals) for classification purposes.

# Recording

Below is a snapshot of the user-defined settings possible during the recording phase. The streaming signals shown in the graph are color coded denoting the different signals. 

The steps in the following demo are:
1. Set desired window frame
2. Set User
3. Set Gesture
4. Click to save recording frame
5. Scroll to view signal features from frame
